           <h3>HALEY</h3>
           <p>Hello I'm Haley Graham! I am a Communication Design Major with a
             concentration in visual design at CSU Monterey Bay. I have a kitty
             named Appa, he is a long-hair Siamese cat and he's the cutest! When
             I am not being distracted by him, I am always doing something creative
             or relaxing. I love making art and doing design work, watching my
             way-too-many plants grow, going on hikes in the mountains, walks on the beach,
             and enjoying large cups of chai and coffee.</p>

          <h3>KAYLA</h3>
          <p>I’m Kayla and I am majoring in Communication Design with a focus in
            Game Design. My hobbies include both gaming and drawing. When it comes
            to drawing, I usually start with traditional pencil and paper. Then,
            I translate it to digital art using apps like Procreate and Photoshop.
            So Adobe Fresco is very much related to my personal skills and interests.</p>

         <h3>ISH</h3>
         <p>What’s up, my name is Ishmael. For short I like going by my nickname Ish.
           At CSUMB I'm a Communication Design major with a focus in Visual Design.
           Some things I enjoy doing are designing art digitally, painting on canvases,
           painting & customizing sneakers, collecting sneakers & hats, playing &
           watching sports, and exploring fashion.</p>

        <h3>ARIANA</h3>
        <p>I’m Ariana and I am majoring in Communications Design. Whenever I want
          to get into a creative flow I always play music. Anything that sparks my
          creativity and gets me excited for what I am about to create. My favorite
          thing to do is find different things in thrift stores (mirrors, old
          paintings, ect) and see how I can turn those forgotten and abandoned
          things into new art. I am very much a traditional artist and find myself
          getting frustrated with digital art more so than when I can just take
          pencil to paper. </p>
