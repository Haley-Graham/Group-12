      <h4>THE BASICS</h4>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column"><p>Adobe Fresco is a free drawing and painting app built especially for Apple Pencil
        and iPad. Fresco is designed for artists who draw professionally or paint for passion.
        Fresco utilizes user favorite photoshop brushes with the precision of vector and live
        brushes. With Fresco you are able to paint with all sorts of mediums that blend, smear,
        and smudge just like it would on paper. Fresco also gives you the ability to work with
        any size lines chrisp or not to allow maximum expression. This app also gives you the
        ability to print in any size without sacrificing quality or pixels. This program gives
        you a lot of freedom to create the projects you're envisioning, whether that be with pixel
        brushes, live brushes, vector brushes, or a mix of all three.</p>
      <p>Fresco (‘fresh’ in Italian) is a painting technique that has been used for centuries
        all over the world. The artist spreads a layer of plaster on a wall or ceiling, then,
        while the plaster is still wet, paints the image using a simple mixture of pigment and
        water. A chemical reaction binds the pigment to the still-wet plaster and the image
        becomes a part of the wall. Once the plaster is dry, the painter has to stop.</p>
      <p>Live Brushes, which use the artificial intelligence of Adobe Sensei to recreate the
        behavior of oils and watercolors in an amazingly lifelike way. When you paint with a
        watercolor Live Brush, you’ll see the color react to the ‘paper’ just like it might in
        real life. For example, when using two colors next to each other, those two will blend
        at the border. You can even recreate painting with water to dilute some colors and
        encourage tints to mix.</p></div>
